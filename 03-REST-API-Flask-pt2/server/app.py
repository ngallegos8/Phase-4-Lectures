# Set up:
    # cd into server and run the following in the terminal
    # export FLASK_APP=app.py
    # export FLASK_RUN_PORT=5000
    # flask db init
    # flask db revision --autogenerate -m'Create tables' or flask db migrate -m "created tables"
    # flask db upgrade 
    # python seed.py
from flask import Flask, request, make_response, abort, jsonify
from flask_migrate import Migrate
# 1.✅ Import NotFound from werkzeug.exceptions for error handling


#2. ✅ Import `Api` and `Resource` from `flask_restful`
    # ❓ What do these two classes do at a higher level? 


from models import db, Production, CrewMember
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///app.db'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False

db.init_app(app)

from models import db, Production
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///app.db'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
# Note: `app.json.compact = False` configures JSON responses to print on indented lines
app.json.compact = False
migrate = Migrate(app, db)
db.init_app(app)

#3. Initialize the Api
    # `api = Api(app)`

#4. Create a Production class that inherits from Resource

#5. Create a GET (All) Route
    # 4.1 Make a `get` method that takes `self` as a param.
    # 4.2 Create a `productions` array.
    # 4.3 Make a query for all productions. For each `production`, create a dictionary 
    # containing all attributes before appending to the `productions` array.
    # 4.4 Create a `response` variable and set it to: 
    #  #make_response(
    #       jsonify(productions),
    #       200
    #  )
    # 4.5 Return `response`.
    # 4.6 After building the route, run the server and test in the browser.

#5. Use our serializer to format our response to be cleaner
    # 10.1 Query all of the productions, convert them to a dictionary with `to_dict` before setting them to a list.
    # 10.2 Invoke `make_response`, pass it the production list along with a status of 200. Set `make_response` to a 
    # `response` variable.
    # 10.3 Return the `response` variable.
    # 10.4 After building the route, run the server and test your results in the browser.
 
#6. Create a POST Route
    # Prepare a POST request in Postman. Under the `Body` tab, select `form-data` and fill out the body 
    # of a production request. 
    
    # Create the POST route 
    # 📚 Review With Students: request object
    # 11.1 Create a `post` method and pass it `self`.
    # 11.2 Create a new production from the `request.form` object.
    # 11.3 Add and commit the new production.
    # 11.4 Convert the new production to a dictionary with `to_dict`
    # 11.5 Set `make_response` to a `response` variable and pass it the new production along with a status of 201.
    # 11.6 Test the route in Postman.

   
#7. Add the new route to our api with `api.add_resource`


#8. Create a GET (One) route
    # 13.1 Build a class called `ProductionByID` that inherits from `Resource`.
    # 13.2 Create a `get` method and pass it the id along with `self`. (This is how we will gain access to 
    # the id from our request)
    # 13.3 Make a query for our production by the `id` and build a `response` to send to the browser.


#9. Add the new route to our api with `api.add_resource`

#10. If a production is not found raise the NotFound exception
    # 3.1 AND/OR use abort() to create a 404 with a customized error message

#11.Patch
    # 4.1 Create a patch method that takes self and id
    # 4.2 Query the Production from the id
    # 4.3 If the production is not found raise the NotFound exception AND/OR use abort() to create a 404 with a customized error message
    # 4.4 Loop through the request.form object and update the productions attributes. Note: Be cautions of the data types to avoid errors.
    # 4.5 add and commit the updated production 
    # 4.6 Create and return the response
  
#12. Delete
    # 5.1 Create a delete method, pass it self and the id
    # 5.2 Query the Production 
    # 5.3 If the production is not found raise the NotFound exception AND/OR use abort() to create a 404 with a customized error message
    # 5.4 delete the production and commit 
    # 5.5 create a response with the status of 204 and return the response 


#13. Use the @app.errorhandler() decorator to handle Not Found
    # 2.1 Create the decorator and pass it NotFound
    # 2.2 Use make_response to create a response with a message and the status 404
    # 2.3 return the response
    
# To run the file as a script

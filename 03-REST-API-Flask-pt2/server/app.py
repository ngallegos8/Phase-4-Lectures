    # `api = Api(app)`

#4. Create a Production class that inherits from Resource
class Productions(Resource):

#5. Create a GET (All) Route
    # 4.1 Make a `get` method that takes `self` as a param.
    # 4.2 Create a `productions` array.
    # 4.3 Make a query for all productions. For each `production`, create a dictionary 
    # containing all attributes before appending to the `productions` array.
    # 4.4 Create a `response` variable and set it to: 
    #  #make_response(
    #       jsonify(productions),
    #       200

#5. Use our serializer to format our response to be cleaner
    # 10.1 Query all of the productions, convert them to a dictionary with `to_dict` before setting them to a list.
    # 10.2 Invoke `make_response`, pass it the production list along with a status of 200. Set `make_response` to a 
    # `response` variable.
    # 10.3 Return the `response` variable.
    # 10.4 After building the route, run the server and test your results in the browser.
 
#6. Create a POST Route
    # Prepare a POST request in Postman. Under the `Body` tab, select `form-data` and fill out the body 
    # of a production request. 
    
    # Create the POST route 
    # üìö Review With Students: request object
    # 11.1 Create a `post` method and pass it `self`.
    # 11.2 Create a new production from the `request.form` object.
    # 11.3 Add and commit the new production.
    # 11.4 Convert the new production to a dictionary with `to_dict`
    # 11.5 Set `make_response` to a `response` variable and pass it the new production along with a status of 201.
    # 11.6 Test the route in Postman.

   
#7. Add the new route to our api with `api.add_resource`

class ProductionById(Resource):

#8. Create a GET (One) route
    # 13.1 Build a class called `ProductionByID` that inherits from `Resource`.
    # 13.2 Create a `get` method and pass it the id along with `self`. (This is how we will gain access to 
    # the id from our request)
    # 13.3 Make a query for our production by the `id` and build a `response` to send to the browser.

#11.Patch
    # 4.1 Create a patch method that takes self and id
    # 4.2 Query the Production from the id
    # 4.3 If the production is not found raise the NotFound exception AND/OR use abort() to create a 404 with a customized error message
    # 4.4 Loop through the request.form object and update the productions attributes. Note: Be cautions of the data types to avoid errors.

#12. Delete
    # 5.1 Create a delete method, pass it self and the id

    # 5.3 If the production is not found raise the NotFound exception AND/OR use abort() to create a 404 with a customized error message

#13. Use the @app.errorhandler() decorator to handle Not Found   ## DYNAMIC compared to 'ABORT'
